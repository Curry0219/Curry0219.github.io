        <h1 id="several-information-about-NBA"><a href="#several-information-about-NBA" class="headerlink" title="several information about NBA"></a>several information about NBA</h1><p>NBA, which is defined in the wekipedia; The National Basketball Association is a men’s professional basketball league in North America, composed of 30 teams. It is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, and is widely considered to be the premier men’s professional basketball league in the world. And it is a place that most boys yearn for it because it has been with us for decades, our youths are included. Individually, I started watch NBA later than the other boys, in the year of 14, I can still remember the scene that I watch NBA match live with my friends secretively, and I still remember I saw Stephen Curry for the first time, his dribble, his posture and his amazing talent. Well honestly, the reason why I watch NBA is inspirited by my idol, Mr. Curry.</p>

<h1 id="Teams"><a href="#Teams" class="headerlink" title="Teams!!!"></a>Teams!!!</h1><p>As I mentioned, there are total 30 teams in NBA, but it was originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations, currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams; another is in Canada.</p>
<p>The current league organization divides 30 teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004–05 season. Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: 13 teams are in the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and five in the Pacific.</p>

<p>all my information are from wekipedia</p>
<h1 id="What-about-my-favorite-player"><a href="#What-about-my-favorite-player" class="headerlink" title="What about my favorite player?"></a>What about my favorite player?</h1><p>Without doubt that the man is Stephen Curry</p>
<p>Wardell Stephen “Steph” Curry II is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association. A six-time NBA All-Star, Curry has been named the NBA Most Valuable Player twice and won three NBA championships with the Warriors.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/t2Zuyd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/06/07/t2Zuyd.jpg" alt="t2Zuyd.jpg"></a></p>
<p>All the stars have their own logos, for example, super star Kobe Bryant’s logo is a triangle-liked logo, it consists of six elements of varying shape. Together, they form another geometric shape resembling a tricorn. The two top “corners” are shorter, while the third “corner” is the longest one. Kobe gave his own explanation to the logo in the Esquire magazine. He said the emblem represented a sword in a sheath. But there was a deeper meaning also. “The sword is the raw talent,” explained Kobe, while the sheath stands for the effort one puts into developing his talent. It is your calluses and your baggage, it is your training. He referred to the logotype as the Sheath, which was supposed to be the official name of the emblem.<br>In addition to this, Eric Avar, who developed the shoe, pointed out that the emblem used Japanese samurai warriors as an inspiration. In Avar’s view, the warriors exhibited the balance of Bryant.</p>
<p>Well focus on Stephen Curry, his logo is much simpler</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/t2uHUI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/06/07/t2uHUI.md.jpg" alt="t2uHUI.md.jpg"></a></p>
<p> it’s shape is the number 30， which is the number of Curry’s number, while the 3 is made of S and stand for Stephen, 0 is C, means Curry.</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/06/07/t2MRXD.jpg" alt="t2MRXD.jpg"></p>
<p>Curry is praised as one of the greatest shooters and point guard, one he has been chosen in the year of 2009, he has played for Golden State Warriors for about 11 years, and this year, he has just overcome his 32th birthday.</p>
<p>If we watch his history, it was not easy for him to get achievement like today. When he was young, maybe because of his father is one of the greatest shooters in the NBA, curry showed his amazing talent on shooting, but because of his body wasn’t strong enough, barely of universities want him to join as one of the team players, but finally, Davidson College chose him which wasn’t a good and famous school and the rank of basketball games is low. But after Curry enters, his shooting skill is better than most children in his age and lead his team into the final. After that, the coach was impressed and built up the whole team as the center of Curry.</p>
<p>In 2009, Curry was chose by Golden State Warriors in the rank of 7.</p>

        <h1 id="Some-information-about-steaks"><a href="#Some-information-about-steaks" class="headerlink" title="Some information about steaks"></a>Some information about steaks</h1><p>In dictionary, the definition of steak is <em>a slice of meat</em> , while in our lives, in western food, steaks are indispensible part, people cook them for meals, but it is unimaginable that there are such many variable methods to cook steak in western cookbooks. Moreover, as a high grade ingredients, steak always matched with some other food, the most particular one is wine, which concludes plenty of lore as well, for instance, Sirloin is the easiest one to go with wines, Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel and Red Bordeaux all fit. And in the following context, I will introduce the classification, source and cooking style for you.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/teoCZT" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/05/28/teoCZT.md.jpg" alt="teoCZT.md.jpg"></a></p>
<h1 id="What’s-the-difference"><a href="#What’s-the-difference" class="headerlink" title="What’s the difference?"></a>What’s the difference?</h1><p>The way and the part we dissect decides different types of steaks. Cuts of steak can be broken down into three sections. Starting on the upper back and moving down to the mid-back you have the rib, the short loin, and the sirloin. The rib contains cuts such as the rib roast, the rib-eye steak, and the back ribs. This is the least tender section of the three. The short loin produces the T-bone, top loin steak, tenderloin, and the porterhouse. The sirloin gives the sirloin steak and the top sirloin. Other steaks like the chuck, round and flank steak come from those respective areas and tend to be tough cuts of meat. Strip steak, like the New York Steak, is cut from the T-bone portion.</p>
<p>The most tender cut of beef is the tenderloin. From this area, you will get cuts like chateaubriand, filet mignon, and tournedos. Though these cuts are tender, they are less flavorful. The rib-eye is less tender but far more flavorful. The same holds true about the sirloin cut.</p>
<p>In addition, the Fillet is the most tender part of a cow, and it barely contains fat, it is recommended to be cooked as medium rare. Sirloin, has fat at the top of the steak, it tastes more tough hence medium rare is best choice or we will feel tired to chew. Another one is Rib-eye, it is noticeable that they have fat in the medium part of the steak, and it should be cooked as medium. The last one is T-bone, it is the combination of Sirloin and Fillet, medium is recommended.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/teorWj" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/05/28/teorWj.gif" alt="teorWj.gif"></a></p>
<h1 id="About-tastes"><a href="#About-tastes" class="headerlink" title="About tastes"></a>About tastes</h1><p>The first one is <em>blue rare</em>, which is the most suitable one for the people who enjoys the taste of blood and the feeling of worry. This kind of steak is full of muscle hemoglobin, which is blood-liked. It is cooked by fry steak on both side for 30-60 seconds in order to maintain the dampness of the beef and create the difference of taste between the outside and inside of steak.</p>
<p>The next one is rare, it is similar to the blue-rare but it is cooked for longer time hence there are more parts are cooked.</p>
<p>Then, the medium rare!! The meat will conduct the heat to the center but doesn’t make too much change, when it is dissected, we can obtain that the upside and downside is cooked beef and the central part is barely cooked, this kind of steak is more juicy.</p>
<p>The medium is not rarely to see, it is the most well balanced one, the inside of the steak is pink and properly fried, which keeps balanced temperature and taste.</p>
<p>Medium well is eaten most in China, people prefer the cooked meet but not relatively rare. The medium well steak is chew resistance. So does the well done steak, which is totally cooked and owns the brown-red appearance.</p>
<p>Moreover, there’s particular care to the sauce that the steak used. There are several types of sauces, and the most common one is Peppercorn, it has alcohol in it and tastes salty. Another one called Steak Sauce, it is smoky flavour, mushroom sauce is another good choice to eat together with steak. It is made by mix beurre and alcohol and mushroom.</p>

<p><strong>USDA GRADING &amp; AMERICAN-STYLE WAGYU</strong></p>
<p>In America, the USDA divides the higher-quality meats into three categories: Select, Choice and Prime (the top tier). Compared to the Wagyu and/or Kobe marbling scale, the best Prime steak would roughly equal to a BMS 3-4. Today Gourmet Foods of NC beef is USDA Upper 2/3 Choice Midwestern corn and grain fed. We offer USDA Prime by way of special order.  reak of foot-and-mouth disease around the mid-2000s, all Japanese beef importation was suspended, giving way to a new wave of domestic production of Wagyu beef. Although there are some American producers of full-blood Wagyu breeds, most of American Wagyu beef comes of a cross between Japanese Wagyu breeds and other classic breeds like Angus. Domestic or American Wagyu follows the Japanese BMS scale for grading meat.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/te71xA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/05/28/te71xA.jpg" alt="te71xA.jpg"></a></p>
<h4 id="Marble-Score-3-And-4"><a href="#Marble-Score-3-And-4" class="headerlink" title="Marble Score 3 And 4"></a>Marble Score 3 And 4</h4><p>Riddled with a good amount of creamy white fat marbling, MS 3 and MS 4 Wagyu beef delivers mouthwatering flavor, and a softer texture than you’ll ever experience from supermarket steaks, all thanks to the privileged flavor profile of Wagyu cattle genetics. At a reasonable price, this is the perfect starter Wagyu…or for those who like to indulge often! </p>
<h4 id="Marble-Score-5-And-6"><a href="#Marble-Score-5-And-6" class="headerlink" title="Marble Score 5 And 6"></a>Marble Score 5 And 6</h4><p>Richer and denser premium steak cuts, with Marble Scores of 5 and 6 you’ll see significantly more of that gorgeous webbing of fat, and you’ll notice a creamier mouth-feel in each bite. Buttery without being overwhelmingly opulent, you still indulge in big portions without risking a richness overload. </p>
<h4 id="Marble-Score-7-And-8"><a href="#Marble-Score-7-And-8" class="headerlink" title="Marble Score 7 And 8"></a>Marble Score 7 And 8</h4><p>With Marble Score 7 and 8 Wagyu you’re entering rarefied realm of the billionaires of beef. There’s a whole new level of richness to these steaks, with softness approaching stick-of-butter levels. Succulent and juicy, that gorgeous web of creamy intramuscular fat – the marbling – which characterizes Wagyu beef spreads more and more throughout the meat, giving it melt-in-your-mouth texture that you’ll never forget.</p>
